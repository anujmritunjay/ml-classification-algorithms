# Naive Bayes Classifier: Comprehensive Guide from Basic to Advanced with Projects

Welcome to this comprehensive repository dedicated to learning Naive Bayes classifiers — including Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli types — starting from fundamentals to advanced concepts, along with practical projects to master the algorithm.

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the assumption that all features are conditionally independent given the class. Despite this simplifying assumption, Naive Bayes classifiers perform very well in many real-world applications, especially text classification such as spam detection and sentiment analysis.

Bayes’ theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available. In plain text, the theorem states:

"Probability of class given the features equals (Probability of features given the class multiplied by Probability of the class) divided by Probability of the features."

Mathematically, it is represented as:

P(C_k | x) = (P(x | C_k) * P(C_k)) / P(x)

where:
- P(C_k | x) is the posterior probability of class C_k given features x,
- P(x | C_k) is the likelihood of features x given class C_k,
- P(C_k) is the prior probability of class C_k,
- P(x) is the evidence or normalizing constant.

For classification tasks, since P(x) is the same for all classes, we can ignore it and focus on computing the numerator, choosing the class that maximizes P(x | C_k) * P(C_k).

The “naive” assumption is that all features x_i are independent of each other given the class C_k, simplifying the likelihood as:

P(x | C_k) = P(x_1 | C_k) * P(x_2 | C_k) * ... * P(x_n | C_k)

This makes computation feasible even in high dimensions.

There are several types of Naive Bayes classifiers depending on the nature of the features:

1. Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes continuous features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. For each feature x_i, given class C_k, the likelihood is computed as:

P(x_i | C_k) = (1 / sqrt(2 * pi * sigma_k^2)) * exp(- (x_i - mu_k)^2 / (2 * sigma_k^2))

where mu_k and sigma_k^2 are the mean and variance of feature x_i in class C_k.

2. Multinomial Naive Bayes: Suited for discrete count data such as word counts in text classification. It calculates the probability of observing each feature count given a class.

3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Works with binary/boolean features, indicating presence or absence of a feature.

Naive Bayes works by first calculating the prior probabilities of classes based on training data frequencies. Then, for a given input, it calculates the likelihoods of feature values given each class, multiplies them, multiplies by the class prior, and selects the class with the highest posterior probability.

Naive Bayes is especially useful when the assumption of feature independence approximately holds, in text classification tasks, with high-dimensional data, and when you need a simple, fast baseline classifier.

Implementation can be done from scratch by estimating priors and likelihoods, or by using libraries such as scikit-learn which offer efficient implementations.
