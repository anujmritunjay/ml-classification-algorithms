# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ‚Äî Complete Learning Guide

Welcome to the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** learning repository!  
This repo covers everything you need to understand, implement, and master KNN from scratch ‚Äî including theory, math, and a list of projects from beginner to advanced.

## üìö What is KNN?

KNN is a simple, intuitive supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It predicts the output for a new input by looking at the 'k' closest data points (neighbors) in the training data.

- **Classification:** Assigns the most common class among neighbors.
- **Regression:** Averages the values of neighbors.

## üîç Theory & Mathematics

### Intuition  
Similar data points tend to be near each other in feature space. KNN uses this property to predict labels or values.

### Distance Metrics  
Common ways to measure closeness between points:
### Distance Metrics

- **Euclidean Distance:**  
  d(p, q) = ‚àö( Œ£ (p·µ¢ - q·µ¢)¬≤ )

- **Manhattan Distance:**  
  d(p, q) = Œ£ |p·µ¢ - q·µ¢|

- **Minkowski Distance:**  
  d(p, q) = ( Œ£ |p·µ¢ - q·µ¢|^m )^(1/m)


### Choosing k  
- Small k ‚Üí Sensitive to noise (overfitting)  
- Large k ‚Üí Smoother boundaries (risk of underfitting)  
- Odd k preferred for classification to avoid ties

### Prediction  
- **Classification:** Majority vote among k neighbors  
- **Regression:** Mean (or weighted mean) of k neighbors‚Äô values
