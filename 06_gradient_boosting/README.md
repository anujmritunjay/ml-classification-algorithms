# üéØ Gradient Boosting: From Basics to Mastery

This document includes:
- ‚úÖ Simple explanations
- üß† Math behind Gradient Boosting (in plain English)
- üìÅ Project ideas (Basic ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced)

## üìö What is Gradient Boosting?

Gradient Boosting is an **ensemble learning technique** that builds a strong model by combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees).

Each new model tries to fix the errors made by the previous ones. It works **sequentially**, and uses **gradient descent** to minimize a loss function.

---

## üß† Math Behind Gradient Boosting (Simplified)

### Goal

We want to minimize the loss between actual and predicted values.

For example, in regression we might use:

**Loss = (y - prediction)^2**

Instead of directly fitting models on actual values, each new model is fit on the **gradient (slope)** of the loss function ‚Äî i.e., the direction of the steepest error reduction.

---

### Step-by-Step Process

1. Start with an initial prediction, usually the mean of target values.
2. Compute the loss (error) between predicted and actual values.
3. Calculate the gradient (how much the prediction should change).
4. Fit a new model to this gradient (residuals).
5. Update predictions:


6. Repeat for many iterations (trees).

---

### Common Loss Functions

- Regression: Mean Squared Error ‚Üí (y - prediction)^2
- Binary Classification: Log Loss ‚Üí -[y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p)]
- Multi-class Classification: Softmax + Log Loss
